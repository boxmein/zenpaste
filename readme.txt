1. About
--------

  I wrote ZenPaste one late summer night (the time of writing was 1373842766902) as a 
  sort of primer into web applications with Express, templates and other cool things.
  As you could expect, most of this project is generated via the express command-line,
  but I promise I wrote at least some of it by hand!

  Why ZenPaste you may ask? 
  I was inspired by the name for ZenPen, mainly because it represented a clean and un-
  disturbing site on which to write your code. I've kind of tried to replicate that, 
  however thanks to some of the plugins I used (et al) it wasn't going to end well.

  Well, at least I now like Jade, expressjs, rainbow.js, jQuery and Emmet.
  Well, I didn't really use Emmet on this project, but on a next one Emmet will surely
  be what I use.

4. How to set up
-----------------

  Acquire Node.js, npm and then run `npm install`. The dependencies are nicely
  listed in package.json. After that, run `node app.js` and it'll run.  
  That's about it.

----------
  
  Each of the Node.js modules are packaged with their own readme's and dependencies,
  which also say what their code can be used for.
